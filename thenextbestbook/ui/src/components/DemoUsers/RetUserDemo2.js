Her only goal was to keep her mouth shut and her grades high so she could win a cheerleading scholarship to Stanford. But that was before she met Bo.\nIn Ridley's wildest dreams, she could never have planned for someone like Bo, for a love so intense it left her breathless. No human girl could.\nA haunting stranger that watched her from afar, Bo stole Ridley's heart from the moment she laid eyes on him. But he has secrets. Bo's a vampire. Both his past and his present are a danger to Ridley, but the biggest threat is not her blood; it's her heart. He's feeding a thirst for revenge that will cost him his life, and it may already be too late.\nThe more darkness Ridley uncovers, the more she realizes that her life will never be the same--with or without Bo. Can she sacrifice her future and her heart for someone who has a death wish?",

Too mysterious and appealing to be good for a girl, Bryn feels drawn to him in a way that seems out of her control--as if fate is orchestrating it.\nDespite every red flag and warning siren going off in her head telling her not to, Bryn falls hard for William, knowing he's categorically different from anyone she's ever met. She never imagined how right she was. When William takes her deeper into the rabbit hole of his world, Bryn must decide just how much she is willing to sacrifice to be with him, knowing no matter what, fate always finds a way to have the last laugh.\nSpinning a new twist on star-crossed lovers, Eternal Eden will put Bryn through a gauntlet of turmoil, challenging her to find the power within herself to become the heroine in her own story.",
